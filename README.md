# Hi there ðŸ‘‹

### My name is Yuliia and this is my website with information about me and my projects.
 
 I am 24 years old. I am from Kyiv. I graduated from Lublin University of technologies with a degree in architecture.

I started my career as a BIM assistant. Me and my colleagues were creating different kind of scripts and algorithms, which were used for automatization.

Then I moved to junior developer position. Our team created a hr db. Based on this data, we created different reports, visual representation and internal website.

I was passioned about creating the front end part of the website, so I decided to deep down in it. I finished Udemy courses, and now I am looking for a job, as a junior front end developer to gain an experience and grow up as a specialist.
